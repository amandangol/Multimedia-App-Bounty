## Explanation
 Here's a description and usage of each feature:

1. `Share Feature`:
  <p align="left"> The share feature allows users to share a specific item from the file server to multiple platforms. When a user selects an item, they can click the "Share" button, which triggers a sharing functionality. The code uses the navigator.share() API to provide a native sharing experience, allowing users to share the item's details, such as name and description, on various platforms like social media, messaging apps, or email.
   
   I chose this feature to enable users to easily share specific items from the Multimedia Web App with others. Sharing is a common and expected functionality in many web applications, especially those dealing with multimedia content. By allowing users to share items, such as images or videos, on various platforms, the app becomes more versatile and aligned with user expectations. The native sharing experience provided by the navigator.share() API ensures a seamless sharing process across different devices and platforms. This feature enhances collaboration and allows users to distribute or showcase multimedia content from the app to a wider audience.

  <h3>How the code works?</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The share feature allows users to share a selected file through various platforms.</li>
  <li>It is implemented using the handleShare function, which is triggered when the user clicks the "Share" button for a file.</li>
  <li>The function takes the selected file as a parameter.</li>
  <li>If the navigator.share API is supported by the browser, it is used to share the file.</li>
  <li>The navigator.share function is called with an object containing the title, text, and URL of the file to be shared.</li>
  <li>If the navigator.share API is not supported, a fallback mechanism is used.</li>
  <li>The shareUrl is encoded and used to generate platform-specific share URLs for platforms like Facebook and Twitter.</li>
  <li>Each platform's share URL is opened in a new browser tab using window.open.</li>
</ul>


2. `Search Box`:
 <p align="left"> The search box feature enables users to search for specific items within the file server. As the user types in the search box, the code captures the input and updates the searchTerm state. Based on the search term, the code performs a search logic to filter and update the searchResults state. The search results are then rendered dynamically based on the updated state, allowing users to see matching items in real-time as they type.
 
  Also, I chose the search box feature to improve the efficiency of finding specific items within the file server. As the number of files or items grows, it        becomes increasingly important to provide a way for users to quickly locate the content they need. The search box allows users to enter search queries and dynamically filters the displayed items based on the input. This feature enhances the user experience by reducing the time and effort required to find specific multimedia files. It improves the app's usability, especially for users who have a large collection of files or need to locate specific items regularly.
 </p>
  <h3>How the code works?</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The search feature allows users to search for specific files by their names.</li>
  <li>It is implemented using the handleSearch function, which is triggered by an onChange event on the search input field.</li>
  <li>The current search query is stored in the searchQuery state variable using the useState hook.</li>
  <li>The useEffect hook is used to perform the search whenever the search query or the myFiles state (containing the list of files) changes.</li>
  <li>Inside the useEffect hook, the myFiles array is filtered based on the search query using the filter function.</li>
  <li>The search results are then displayed in the UI if there is a search query and the searchResults array is not empty.</li>
</ul>

3. `Files Details and Metadata`:
  <p align="left"> This feature provides additional information about each file in the file server. The code includes a FileDetails component that displays various metadata of a file, such as its name, size, created date, and author. The metadata is obtained from the file object and rendered alongside the file's name and description. This allows users to have a comprehensive overview of each file, including when it was created and who authored it.
 </p>
 
 
   <p>Overall, the search feature allows users to filter and display files based on their names, making it easier to find specific files. The share feature provides options to share files through supported platforms or opens a new tab with the file URL for unsupported platforms.</p>
   <h4>There are also some design enhancements.</h4> :)
