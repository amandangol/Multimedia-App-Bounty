The features that are added on the multimedia application are :
Share Feature: The share feature allows users to share a specific item from the file server to multiple platforms. When a user selects an item, they can click the "Share" button, which triggers a sharing functionality. The code uses the navigator.share() API to provide a native sharing experience, allowing users to share the item's details, such as name and description, on various platforms like social media, messaging apps, or email.

Search Box: The search box feature enables users to search for specific items within the file server. As the user types in the search box, the code captures the input and updates the searchTerm state. Based on the search term, the code performs a search logic to filter and update the searchResults state. The search results are then rendered dynamically based on the updated state, allowing users to see matching items in real-time as they type.

File Details and Metadata: This feature provides additional information about each file in the file server. The code includes a FileDetails component that displays various metadata of a file, such as its name, size, created date, and author. The metadata is obtained from the file object and rendered alongside the file's name and description. This allows users to have a comprehensive overview of each file, including when it was created and who authored it.
